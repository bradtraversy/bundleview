- **File Explorer**: Detailed breakdown of individual files and their contributions
- **Statistics Panel**: Detailed metrics and performance indicators

### üí° **Optimization Insights**

- **Smart Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions for bundle optimization
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify large dependencies, code splitting opportunities, and tree shaking potential
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and eliminate redundant code in your bundles
- **Compression Analysis**: Evaluate gzip efficiency and compression ratios

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bradtraversy/bundleview.git
   cd bundleview
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## üìÅ Supported File Types

### 1. **Compiled Bundle Files (.js)**

- Direct analysis of minified/compiled bundles
- Fallback analysis when detailed metadata isn't available
- Estimates module structure and sizes

### 2. **JavaScript Source Maps (.js.map)**

- Generated during build processes
- Maps compiled code back to source
- Useful for understanding bundle composition

### 3. **Webpack Bundle Analyzer JSON**

- Export from webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Contains detailed module information and dependencies
- Provides the most detailed analysis

## üéØ How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your Bundle
